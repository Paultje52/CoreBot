# SupaBotBase
An easy-to-use Discord.js Bot base with messages and interactions support.<br>
Todo for **`v1.2.0`**.
- [x] Rewrite the args system for commands
- [x] Add button support
- [x] Fix button support for slash commands
- [ ] Add slash command permissions
- [ ] Add documentation

### **Discord.js**
SupaBotBase is based off discord.js `v12`. That version doesn't support slash commands and message buttons (yet). As soon as discord.js `v13` is out **for production** or the interactions support is there for `v12`, SupaBotBase makes their own API calls.


## Documentation
Look at the [GitHub repository wiki](https://github.com/Paultje52/SupaBotBase/wiki) for the documentation.

## Example
**bot.js**
```js
// Require the SupaBotBase package
const SupaBotBase = require("SupaBotBase");
// Construct the bot
let bot = new SupaBotBase({
  dir: __dirname
});
// Load the commands in the "commands" directory
bot.loadCommands("commands").then(async () => {
  // Start the bot and wait until it's started
  await bot.start();
  // Automaticly register slash commands
  bot.registerSlashCommands();
});
```
**token.txt**
```
YOUR BOT TOKEN
```
**commands/ping.js**
```js
const CommandConstructor = require("SupaBotBase").CommandConstructor;

module.exports = class Ping extends CommandConstructor {

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.setHelp({
      name: "ping",
      description: "Test my ping"
    });
    this.setSlashCommandType("hidden");
  }

  async onExecute(message) {
    message.answerCommand(`**Ping**\nðŸ’™ ${Math.round(this.client.ws.ping)}`);
  }

}
```

This project uses the MIT licence. It would be great if you want to put a link to the SupaBotBase somewhere in your bot, but it isn't required. Here is a copy of the licence, but it's also found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
